Prototyping semantic search for training provider and trainers dataset

## Code: Getting started

- Set up a Python virtual environment and install required packages from [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt);
- `demo_bm25_retriever.py` implements a semantic search system by combining BM25 retrieval with HuggingFace embeddings. Requires `load_csv_2_docs.py` for document preprocessing and `embed_docs.py` for document embedding to be run prior.
- `demo_semantic_search_retriever.py` implements a semantic search system using HuggingFace embeddings and Chroma vector stores. It demonstrates two retrieval methods: similarity-based search and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) search, using a pre-trained embedding model (`bge-small-en-v1.5`) to convert text into vector embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of the documents. Requires `load_csv_2_docs.py` for document preprocessing and `embed_docs.py` for document embedding to be run prior.
- `demo_openai.py` implements a semantic search system using OpenAI embeddings and Chroma vector database. Requires `load_csv_2_docs.py` for document preprocessing and `embed_docs.py` for document embedding to be run prior.
- `trainers_preprocess.py` - This code loads trainer details from an Excel file into a pandas DataFrame and then converts the DataFrame into a format suitable for use with LangChain. It sets up an embedding model using HuggingFaceâ€™s BGE and creates a vector store using Chroma, storing the embeddings and documents in a specified directory. This setup facilitates efficient document retrieval and similarity search based on the trainer descriptions.
- `trainers_semantic_search.py` - This script loads the previously created vector store and executes a single query using similarity search. The search parameters `search_kwargs` can be modified to perform a filter on a metadata column before the semantic search is executed. This script is useful for experimentation.
- `trainers_semantic_search_with_eval.py` - This script is an updated version of the \path{trainers_semantic_search.py} with the main difference that this script loads all test queries and executes the semantic search for each of them with the corresponding expected results.
